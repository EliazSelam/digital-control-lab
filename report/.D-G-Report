📄 Digital Control Lab – Observer-Based Control Simulation Report

🔧 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a discrete-time control system design using state feedback and a dead-beat observer. The full simulation is implemented in MATLAB and includes both controller-only and observer-based configurations, with visual comparisons and error analysis.

⚙️ System Definition
	•	State matrix A = [0 0.5; 0 2]
	•	Input matrix B = [0.1; 1]
	•	Output matrix C = [1 -1]
	•	Sampling time Ts = 0.2 s

🧮 Design Specifications
	•	Feedback poles chosen via characteristic polynomial:
D_w(z) = z^2 - 1.6z + 0.64
	•	Observer poles (dead-beat):
D_e(z) = z^2
	•	DC gain target: 10
	•	Gains computed using acker().

🧠 Key Components
	•	State Feedback Gain R
	•	Observer Gain L
	•	DC Gain ρ computed to ensure unity gain at steady-state for r_in = 1

📊 Simulation Results

Simulation compares:
	•	Controller-only system: assumes full state knowledge.
	•	Observer-based system: uses estimated state via observer.

📁 Output Files:

All plots are saved under /DigitalControlPlots/:
	•	pzmap.png: Pole-zero map of the closed-loop system
	•	step_response.png: Step response of the system
	•	simulation_comparison.png: Comparison of output y(k) with and without observer
	•	state_estimation_error.png: Estimation error x - x̂ over time

📌 Highlights
	•	Clear comparison between controller designs
	•	Dead-beat observer reaches convergence in just a few steps
	•	Simulation is modular and beginner-friendly

💬 Next Steps
	•	Try different pole placements and sampling times
	•	Extend to MIMO systems or unstable plants
