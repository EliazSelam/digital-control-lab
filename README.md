# 🔧 Digital Control Lab – Final Project

This project is a professional adaptation of my final lab assignment in **Digital Control Systems**, focusing on **Z-transform analysis**, **stability checks**, and **time/frequency domain simulations** using **MATLAB**.

It demonstrates the full engineering workflow from theoretical formulation to simulation, visualization, and result extraction – all structured for clarity, reproducibility, and GitHub presentation.

## ⚙️ Key Concepts

- Discrete-time transfer functions
- Z-transform pole-zero analysis
- Root locus and step response
- Bode plot in Z-domain
- Stability check (unit-circle test)
- Simulation with MATLAB Control Toolbox

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open `code/main.m` in MATLAB
2. Run the script to:
   - Define the system
   - Simulate and plot responses
   - Save output to `/plots/` and `/results/`
3. Check `/results/summary.txt` for numeric analysis
4. Review generated plots for insight

---

## 📊 Sample Outputs

All plots are saved automatically to `/plots/` when running the code:

- `step_response.png`
- `bode_plot.png`
- `pzmap.png`

You can embed them into the README for visual showcase.
