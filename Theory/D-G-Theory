🧠 Theoretical Background – Digital State Feedback & Observer

	1.	Discrete-Time State-Space Model
A linear discrete-time system is modeled as:
  x[k+1] = A·x[k] + B·u[k],  y[k] = C·x[k] + D·u[k]
where x is the state vector, u is the input, and y is the output.
⸻
	2.	State Feedback
The goal of state feedback is to control system dynamics using:
  u[k] = –R·x[k] + ρ·r[k]
The gain R is selected so that A₍cl₎ = A – B·R places the closed-loop poles as desired.
ρ ensures stable tracking of a reference signal r[k].
⸻
	3.	DC Gain Compensation
To eliminate steady-state error and ensure accurate tracking:
  ρ = Gₛₛ / [C·(z·I – A₍cl₎)⁻¹·B], with z = 1
This guarantees that y[k] → r[k] in steady state.
⸻
	4.	Luenberger Observer
When not all states can be measured, an observer is used:
  ẋ̂[k+1] = A·x̂[k] + B·u[k] + L·(y[k] – C·x̂[k])
The observer gain L is designed so that the estimation error x – x̂ converges quickly by placing the poles of A – L·C appropriately.
⸻
	5.	Dead-Beat Observer
Setting observer poles at the origin (z = 0) ensures the estimation error reaches zero in a finite number of steps
(usually ≤ number of states). Best suited for low-noise discrete systems.
⸻
	6.	Separation Principle
In linear systems, the controller (R) and observer (L) can be designed independently. 
The overall system remains stable with A – B·R and A – L·C governing dynamics separately.
This principle enables modular design.
⸻
	7.	Observability Condition
An observer can be constructed only if the system is observable, meaning the observability matrix:
  𝓞 = [C; C·A; C·A²; …]
has full rank. This must be verified before designing L.
⸻
	8.	Nyquist Sampling and Discrete Design
Sampling must satisfy the Nyquist criterion (twice the highest system frequency) to preserve signal integrity. 
If sampling is too slow, poles may shift outside the unit circle, causing instability.
⸻
	9.	Observer Error Convergence
The estimation error e[k] = x[k] – x̂[k] converges to zero at a rate set by the observer poles.
The closer the poles are to the origin, the faster the convergence—though this increases sensitivity to noise.
⸻
	10.	Practical Use
Observers are essential when sensor access is limited or expensive.
Combined with state feedback, they enable smart systems with minimal direct measurement.

Conclusion
Combining state feedback, observer design, and DC gain compensation allows precise control of discrete-time systems. 
The separation principle ensures flexible and modular analysis, forming a foundational approach to digital control design.
